Homework 4

Other than a couple of i's l's and 1's being typo'd and causing hours of headache, the game went smoothly.

Also, Microsoft's Math.Random() does not work in Unity, as Unity has an implementation. A note I keep forgetting.

What I implemented was the Gold card. As the way the book suggests to implement it is vague in order of scoring, I decided that I wanted it to be a 'push your luck' aspect to the game. It rewards adding it to a longer run as it doubles your current streak instead of adding one.

10% seems to be a good number for the amount of gold cards, however, I've had two games where 0 cards were gold. An improvement may be to have a minimum amount.

Lastly, I still can't get WebGL builds to work on TAZ, so it is zipped in D2L.
Crunched this out in like one sitting, so no rich git commit history.
